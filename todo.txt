* strategy: base + offset
* track r0 usage after log call, ensure it's dead or clobbered before next use.
* json exporting
* runtime api for "is this binary or ascii"
* runtime api for "serialize call to a binary buffer"
* TBB/TBH logic is janky; looking at the last cmp_imm of the offset reg is gross
* BL targeting known noreturn functions should terminate (exit, assert, etc)
