* strategy: base + offset
* track r0 usage after log call, ensure it's dead or clobbered before next use.
* json exporting
* TBB/TBH logic is janky; looking at the last cmp_imm of the offset reg is gross
* Better logging around "ran off the end" (show last BL target)
* runtime: log buffers
* star args for field width and precision
