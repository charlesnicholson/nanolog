* strategy: base + offset
* track r0 usage after log call, ensure it's dead or clobbered before next use.
* TBB/TBH logic is janky; looking at the last cmp_imm of the offset reg is gross
* runtime: log buffers
* star args for field width and precision
* test stargs (field width + precision)
* unclog emits "dynamic" for severity when nanolog_log_sev[_ctx] called
